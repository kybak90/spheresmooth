#' A polar wander dataset
#'
#' A polar wander dataset presented in Kent and Irving (2010). The 17 Triassic/Jurassic cratonic poles from other major cratons are rotated into North American coordinates and combined with the 14 observations from North America. Our method is applied to these 31 observations ranging in age from 243 to 144 Ma (millions of years ago), which covers the late Triassic and Jurassic periods. The first column represents the time points, and the remaining two columns provides the observed spherical coordinates.
